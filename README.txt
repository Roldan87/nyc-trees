#  NYC Street Trees Census - Tree Data<br/>

##  The Mission<br/>

>The Department of Environmental Conservation, from New York City, has recently made the news by telling the people that<br/> 
>they needed their help. Indeed, their request is simple:<br/>
>They needed the people of New York City, whether young or old, to go to the nearest tree in their street and<br/>
>gather information about that tree. This is all in an effort to make the population aware that nature is important,<br/>
>even in big Metropolis like NYC. Now that they have heard back from the people,<br/>
>the DEC noticed that they missed a crucial step. They forgot to give the people a data collection guide,<br/>
>and so the data they received back is a bit messy.<br/>
><br/>
>I will help them clean the data so that they can begin to raise awareness to ecological issues, such as climate change.<br/>
