# NYC Street Trees Census - Tree Data<br/>

## The Mission<br/>

>The Department of Environmental Conservation, from New York City, has recently made the news by telling the people that they needed their help. <br/>
>Indeed, their request is simple: They needed the people of New York City, whether young or old, to go to the nearest tree in their street and gather information about that tree.<br/>
>This is all in an effort to make the population aware that nature is important, even in big Metropolis like NYC. Now that they have heard back from the people,<br/>
>the DEC noticed that they missed a crucial step. They forgot to give the people a data collection guide, and so the data they received back is a bit messy.<br/>
>
>I will help them clean the data so that they can begin to raise awareness to ecological issues, such as climate change.<br/>
